        <h2>About the Project</h2>

        <p>Our Text-to-Code Generation project is a cutting-edge NLP solution that translates everyday text into
             functional code! 💻🚀 Let’s dive into how it all comes together:

            <h2>🧠 Powered by Advanced AI </h2>

            <p> We’ve built our solution using the EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B Large Language Model. This robust model
                 forms the brain 🧠 of our project, leveraging its advanced understanding of natural language to 
                 generate precise code from simple text descriptions! 🎉</p>
            


            <h2>📚 Fine-Tuned for Python Code </h2>
            <p>To ensure the model is code-savvy, we’ve fine-tuned it using the 
                iamtarun/python_code_instructions_18k_alpaca dataset, which contains thousands of Python code 
                instructions. 🐍💡 By training the model on this data, we’ve made it proficient in generating 
                clean, Python-specific code in response to everyday language. 📖💻 </p>
            


            <h2> ⚙️ Techniques for Performance</h2>
            <p>To keep our model efficient and optimized for real-world applications, we’ve applied two powerful 
                techniques: <br>
            
            <b> Quantization 📏: </b> By using quantization, we’ve significantly reduced the model size, which boosts performance without compromising quality. This allows the model to run smoothly on platforms like Google Colab! 🚀💻
            <br><br>
            <b>LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) 🔧:</b> We’ve used LoRA to fine-tune our model, making it faster and more efficient at learning specialized code generation skills. This helps the model stay agile and responsive! 💨✨
            


            <h2>🖥️ Interactive Front-End with Flask</h2>
            <p>Our model’s intelligence isn’t just hidden in the backend! We’ve crafted a Flask-based front end 🌐
             that enables users to input text queries and see real-time code output. Flask’s flexibility allows 
             us to design an intuitive and interactive interface where users can easily test out different text 
             prompts and watch the model convert them to functional code in seconds! ⏱️💡</p>
            



            <h2>🔍 How It Works </h2>

            <p><b>1. Enter a Query 📝:</b> Users provide a text-based description of the code they need. <br>
            <b>2. Model Generation 🧠:</b> The model processes the input and generates Python code. <br>
            <b>3. Real-Time Output 📄:</b> The generated code appears on the front end for instant viewing and testing!</p>
            
            



            <h2>✨ Key Benefits </h2>
            <p><b>User-Friendly 🌟:</b> Designed with a simple front-end interface, making it accessible for both developers and non-developers!
             <br>
            <b>Efficiency 🚀:</b> Quantization and LoRA ensure a fast and lean model. <br>

            <b>Real-Time Feedback ⏱️:</b> Instantly converts your words to code!</p>
